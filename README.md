# Hello, I'm Ori Meidler ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Statistics & Data Science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Here are some of my recent projects:

- **[Telegram Bot Using Kalamn Filter to predict Sugar Levels for Type 1 Diabetics](https://github.com/orineo1/predicting_sugar_level_T1D):**
  - A project utilizing a Kalman filter and a Telegram bot to predict and warn of undesirable sugar values, specifically designed for type 1 diabetics. 
  - This project originated from a personal concern â€” my wife's Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The goal was to find a tool that proactively alerts about potential blood sugar drops.

- **[CRM Experiment Implementation Using Dash](https://github.com/orineo1/CRM-Experiment-Implementation):**
  - A web application designed to carry out experiments on medication dosage using the CRM model.

- **[Are Sequel Movies Really Worse? Hypothesis Testing with IMDb Ratings](https://github.com/AvivGelfand/GrandmizersShtick-Huji-Hackathon23):**
  - A Python application that generates conversations using **generative AI** and converts them into audio files.

- **[Are Sequel Movies Really Worse? Hypothesis Testing with IMDb Ratings](https://github.com/orineo1/Are-Sequel-Movies-Really-Worse-):**
  - A summer vacation project exploring whether sequel movies are greater, the same, or worse than their predecessors using IMDb ratings and statistical assumptions.
    
- **[WiFiGuard: Monitoring and Restart Script Router:](https://github.com/orineo1/WiFiGuard):**
  - My TP-LINK Router encounters issues, occasionally disconnecting from the internet. This script monitors the status of the WiFi, and if any issues are detected, it initiates a restart.
