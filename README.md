# Hello, I'm Ori Meidler ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Statistics & Data Science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Here are some of my recent projects:

- **[Predicting Sugar Levels for Type 1 Diabetics](https://github.com/orineo1/predicting_sugar_level_T1D):**
  - A project that employs a Kalman filter and a Telegram bot to predict and warn of undesirable sugar values, specifically designed for type 1 diabetics.

- **[CRM Experiment Implementation](https://github.com/orineo1/CRM-Experiment-Implementation):**
  - A web application designed to carry out experiments on medication dosage using the CRM model.

- **[GrandmizersShtick-Huji-Hackathon23](https://github.com/AvivGelfand/GrandmizersShtick-Huji-Hackathon23):**
  - A Python application that generates conversations using GPT and converts them into audio files.

- **[Are Sequel Movies Really Worse](https://github.com/orineo1/Are-Sequel-Movies-Really-Worse-):**
  - A summer vacation project exploring whether sequel movies are greater, the same, or worse than their predecessors using IMDb ratings and statistical assumptions.
