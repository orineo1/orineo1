# Hello, I'm Ori Meidler ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Statistics & Data Science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Here are some of my recent projects:

- **[Telegram Bot Using Kalamn Filter to predict Sugar Levels for Type 1 Diabetics](https://github.com/orineo1/predicting_sugar_level_T1D):**
  - A project utilizing a Kalman filter and a Telegram bot to predict and warn of undesirable sugar values, specifically designed for type 1 diabetics. 
  - This project originated from a personal concern â€” my wife's Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The goal was to find a tool that proactively alerts about potential blood sugar drops.

- **[CRM Experiment Implementation Using Dash](https://github.com/orineo1/CRM-Experiment-Implementation):**
  - A web application designed to carry out experiments on medication dosage using the CRM model.

- **[GrandmizersShtick - Hackaton-Huji-2023 - Generative AI using API](https://github.com/AvivGelfand/GrandmizersShtick-Huji-Hackathon23):**
  - A Python application that generates conversations using **generative AI** and converts them into audio files.

- **[Diffusion Models with Alternative Noising Distributions and Schedules](https://github.com/ron-taieb/SchedNoise-Diffusion):**
  - Explores diffusion models by extending the conventional framework with alternative noise distributions, including GMM and Gamma, as well as incorporating scheduling strategies such as sigmoid, cosine, and a new dynamic approach we thought of.
    
- **[Are Sequel Movies Really Worse? Hypothesis Testing with IMDb Ratings](https://github.com/orineo1/Are-Sequel-Movies-Really-Worse-):**
  -A summer vacation project from my first year of undergraduate studies, exploring whether sequel movies tend to outperform, match, or fall short of their predecessors based on IMDb ratings. This project leverages statistical hypothesis testing and introduces key statistical concepts through a fun and relatable topic. While it is somewhat childish, I like that project:)
